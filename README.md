# 🤖Blockchain AI Agent using ELIZA Framework

## 🔥 Introduction
The Blockchain AI Agent is an AI-powered chatbot that interacts with smart contracts, DeFi platforms, NFTs, and Web3 applications using the ELIZA framework. By combining natural language processing (NLP) with blockchain automation, this agent can provide real-time insights, execute smart contract functions, and analyze blockchain data.

## 🚀 Features
- AI-driven Smart Contract Interaction 
- Execute Ethereum/Solana smart contracts using natural language commands.
- On-Chain Data Analysis 
- Retrieve blockchain transaction data, DeFi statistics, and NFT insights.
- Fraud Detection & Security 
- Analyze blockchain transactions and identify suspicious activity.
- AI-Powered Trading Bots 
- Automate DeFi yield farming, arbitrage, and NFT trading strategies.
- Decentralized AI for DAOs 
- Assist in proposal analysis and governance voting.

## 📌 Use Cases
