Introduction
Welcome to the AI Agent project powered by the ELIZA framework! This chatbot simulates human-like conversations using classic natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It is designed to provide an engaging, interactive, and intelligent conversational experience.
ELIZA is one of the earliest AI-powered chatbots that mimics human interactions using pattern matching and scripted responses. By leveraging the ELIZA framework, this chatbot can provide automated responses that feel natural and intuitive.

## üöÄ Features
- AI-powered chatbot based on the ELIZA framework.
- Natural language understanding (NLU) using pattern-based responses.
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into web applications, messaging platforms, and chatbot services.
- Fully customizable conversation scripts.
- Open-source and extendable for modern AI and NLP applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
The ELIZA chatbot uses rule-based pattern matching to analyze user input and generate predefined responses. The key components include:
